# two-bladed-wind-turbines  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13269498.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13269498)
This repository is supposed to share two- and three-bladed 20MW wind turbine models to use in DNV's Bladed, together with the controller files and respective turbine data from the German government-funded project "X-Rotor -- two-bladed wind turbines" with the research community.

If you want to use the models, please remember to adapt the paths to the superelement of the jacket foundation, to the respective controller .dlls, and to the external load .dll in case of the two-bladed teetering turbine.

In general, the latest version of the controller .dll v31 is applicable to all these turbines. However, there are slight differences in the internal damper gains.

If there are any questions, please feel free to text me or pull a request herein.

Best regards,
Fabian
